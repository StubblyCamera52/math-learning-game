# Math Learning Game
### (name is a work in progress)
![alt text](https://github.com/StubblyCamera52/math-learning-game/blob/main/screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Description
This is a math practice/homework web app where you can answer questions to get coins and then either gamble those coins to get more coins (or lose them) or spend them in the shop to unlock new math.
#
I didn't meet all of my goals on this yet, the app is not as fun as it could be and I still have more gamification to do.
This project is still a work in progress and I will probably keep updating it even after siege because I plan on using it in a real classroom in the future.

## Demo (try it out)

## Inspiration
When I grow up I want to be a math teacher, but when I'm in math class, I see so many disinterested students, who are falling behind just because they dont practice, I want to make an app for fun so that people can have fun doing math. Because I love math and I want other people to love it too (selfish I know).
